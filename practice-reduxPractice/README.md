# React Redux Practice 1

For this module I am learning Redux toolkit js. This is a store state management for react. Main feature for redux is to make state management easy and readable along side alot easier. Redux is usable with any js framework and is currently being utilized in this project for react.

To get a hand on redux structure and usage we are building a really simple counter app. Redux toolkit creates a store state that will be used to mage all our individual states. A good comparison would be a sql database. Our state is the database and the slices that manage eat state and manipulate is our tables.

Once our state store exists we utilize use selector in our code to access state and useDispute to manipulate our data.

The guide I will be following for this practice is provided below:
